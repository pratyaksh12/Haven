# Haven
Haven architecture treats the web like a blockchain, trustless, opaque, and immutable. It transfers data through the web without the server ever knowing what it is carrying. Your password never leaves your device, meaning the system is secure by mathematics, not by some company policy. It is perfectly secure. Until you LOSE your password, at which point it becomes mathematically impossible to recover, I mean safety at its peak no.
